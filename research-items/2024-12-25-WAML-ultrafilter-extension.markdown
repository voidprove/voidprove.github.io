  Weakly aggregative modal logics (WAML) are a series of natural weakenings of the minimal modal logic K. The natural semantics for them are based on Kripke frames with an (n+1)-ary relation, where □φ is true at a world iff all of its successor n-tuples has at least one world making φ true. We study the notion of saturated models and ultrafilter extension for this relational semantics of WAML. The Goldblatt-Thomason theorem for WAML is proved as an application.
