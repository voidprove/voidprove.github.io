  Weakly Aggregative Modal Logic (WAML) is a collection of disguised polyadic modal logics with n-ary modalities whose arguments are all the same. WAML has interesting applications on epistemic logic, deontic logic, and the logic of belief. In this paper, we study some basic model theoretical aspects of WAML. Specifically, we first give a van Benthem-Rosen characterization theorem of WAML based on an intuitive notion of bisimulation. Then, in contrast to many well known normal or non-normal modallogics, we show that each basic WAML system Kn lacks Craig interpolation. Finally, by model theoretical techniques, we show that an extension of K2 does have Craig interpolation, as an example of amending the interpolation problem of WAML.
